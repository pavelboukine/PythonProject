# Pipeline Data Management System

This project is a Python-based application designed to manage pipeline data, with features for loading, editing, deleting, and saving records. It also includes a new feature to visualize data using horizontal bar charts.

## Features
- **Data Management:**
  - Load pipeline records from a CSV file.
  - Add, edit, and delete records.
  - Save updated records to a new CSV file.
- **Data Visualization:**
  - Generate horizontal bar charts to visualize aggregated pipeline data (e.g., throughput or available capacity).
  - Interactive options to select the field and customize the output.
- **Dynamic Record Classification:**
  - Automatically formats records based on throughput values.
  
## Learning Outcomes
- Explored advanced Python features such as inheritance and polymorphism.
- Gained experience with data visualization using Matplotlib.
- Practiced dynamic classification of data records based on real-time input.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- Matplotlib
